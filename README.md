# Transit Access Research - Chicago's South Side
#### Research for my spatial data science course at UChicago, investigating changes in access to transit on Chicago's South Side.

Code for the travel time analysis, regressions, and station infill spatial optimization problem can be found in the file [Transit_Access_Analysis_SS_Chi.ipynb](https://github.com/hanksnowdon/TransitAccessResearch-SouthSideChicago/blob/main/Transit_Access_Analysis_SS_Chi.ipynb). 

An online version of the full research paper can be found [here](https://hanksnowdon.github.io/Portfolio/posts/chi_ss_transit/).
