# Transit Access Research - Chicago's South Side
#### Research for my graduate spatial DS course at UChicago, investigating changes in access to transit on Chicago's South Side.

Code for the travel time analysis, regressions, and station infill spatial optimization problem can be found in the file [Transit_Access_Analysis_SS_Chi.ipynb]([url](https://github.com/hanksnowdon/TransitAccessResearch-SouthSideChicago/blob/main/Transit_Access_Analysis_SS_Chi.ipynb)). 

Full writeup of research paper with full analysis and background will be published soon.
